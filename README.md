# Avocado CRM MUI

Avocado CRM MUI is a React frontend built from the Avocado CRM project. It requires the BFF service [avocado-crm](https://github.com/zwnormal/avocado) to run. Currently only login function is implemented.

## Build and Run
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npm run dev` then access the frontend in web browser. When on the login page, please use the username `admin@avocado.com` and password `kIxv4NomLT0WwGKF` to login.

Please note there are still improvements which can be made for the current code, as currently the main layout is done, but efforts are needed to extract those project specific components into their own code files.
